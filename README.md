# Euler-Project

This repository is dedicated to providing solutions to the problems listed in [project Euler](https://projecteuler.net). We attempt solving each problem in several programming languages while maintaining the expressiveness of the implementation. Currently the repository is still a work-in-progress and will be periodically updated over the next couple of months. 

Although not all problems will be strictly solved in **all** proposed programming languages, the majority of them will be.

#### Programming languages used:
- Python
- C
- Java
- JavaScript (TypeScript)
- RUST

Since each programming language imposes a different file structure due to inherent differences in the languages themselves , e.g. Java vs python vs C, the solutions structure will differ accordingly.

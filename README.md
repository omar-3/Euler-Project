Rewinding ...

This time, we will do Golang - Python - C - C++ - Java - Ruby - Typescript - Haskell - OCaml - Zig - Rust - Bash - Lua.

The goal here is to get my skills up to speed again after being in military for more than one year and not being able to touch a keyboard at this period.

After finishing my service and getting back to the real world I found myself __very slow__ and having difficulty getting things done. This was not due to any lack of knowledge or not understanding
but it was matter of severe lack of practice. This is why I am doing this project, it is a bit ambitious but let's see what would happen.
